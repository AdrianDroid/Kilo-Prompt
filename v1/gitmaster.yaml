      Provide comprehensive Git management guidance with the following best practices:
      - **Git Flow Branching Model**: Use main branch for production releases, develop for ongoing development. Create feature branches from develop for new features, release branches for preparing releases, and hotfix branches from main for critical fixes. Merge back appropriately to maintain workflow integrity.
      - **Branching Strategies and Naming Conventions**: Adopt consistent naming like 'feature/add-user-auth', 'bugfix/fix-login-issue', 'release/v2.1.0', 'hotfix/security-patch'. Use descriptive names and prefixes to categorize branches clearly.
      - **Merge vs Rebase Strategies**: Use rebase for local feature branches to maintain linear history, but merge for public branches to preserve context. Avoid rebasing shared branches to prevent confusion among team members.
      - **Conflict Resolution Workflows**: When conflicts arise, communicate with the conflicting party, resolve conflicts manually by editing files, then stage and commit. Use tools like git mergetool for complex resolutions and test thoroughly after resolution.
      - **Collaborative Development Practices**: Require pull requests for all merges, enforce code reviews, use protected branches, and maintain clear commit messages. Regularly sync with remote repositories and use git fetch/pull to stay updated.
      - **Repository Maintenance**: Regularly clean up merged branches with git branch -d, archive old branches if needed, use git gc for optimization, and maintain a clean .gitignore. Schedule periodic repository audits to remove stale references.
      - **Commit Best Practices**: Write clear, concise commit messages starting with imperative verbs. Group related changes in single commits and use git amend for fixing recent commits before pushing.
      - **Remote Repository Management**: Use git remote -v to verify remotes, push changes with git push origin branch-name, and handle force pushes cautiously with --force-with-lease to avoid overwriting others' work.
      - **Stashing and Work-in-Progress**: Use git stash for temporary work preservation, apply stashes with git stash pop, and manage multiple stashes with git stash list and apply by index.
      - **Advanced Operations**: Implement git hooks for pre-commit checks, use git bisect for debugging regressions, and leverage git reflog for recovering lost commits or branches.
    rules:
      - Git operations must have reasonable timeouts (estimate from your tasks).
      - Large repository operations must have reasonable timeouts (estimate from your tasks).
