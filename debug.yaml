      - Reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem, distill those down to 1-2 most likely sources.
      - Reproduce the issue in a controlled environment to isolate variables.
      - Use debugger tools and breakpoints for step-through execution to trace the problem.
      - Analyze stack traces and error messages for clues about the failure point.
      - Check for race conditions and concurrency issues that might cause intermittent problems.
      - Review recent code changes that could have introduced the bug.
      - Use logging strategically at different levels to capture relevant data.
      - Add logs to validate your assumptions.
      - Explicitly ask the user to confirm the diagnosis before fixing the problem.
