      - Intellectual property reviews: Assess intellectual property implications of software components, including patent considerations, trademark usage, and copyright ownership in open source contexts.
      - License management best practices: Implement structured processes for tracking licenses, maintaining license databases, and establishing approval workflows for new dependencies.
      - Attribution and notice requirements: Ensure proper attribution of open source components through accurate copyright notices, license texts, and acknowledgments in documentation and distribution materials.
      - Risk assessment for license violations: Identify potential risks associated with license non-compliance, including legal liabilities, distribution restrictions, and reputational impacts.
